## Project Overview

YouTube RSS Subscriptions — a self-hosted, RSS-first YouTube feed reader. Tracks
watched state, filters Shorts, queues videos for later, and stays RSS-first so
routine refreshes don't burn YouTube API quota.

It's a feed reader, not a video archive. Videos still play through YouTube.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 3, Zustand, TanStack
  Query
- **Server:** Node.js, Express (implied), SQLite (WAL mode)
- **Container:** `ghcr.io/greg-hass/mytube:latest`
- **Port mapping:** Host `5173` → Container `8080`
- **Volume:** `mytube-data` → `/app/server/data`
- **Health check:** `http://localhost:8080/api/healthz`

## Priorities

1. Correctness
2. Reliability
3. Maintainability
4. Security
5. Performance

Prefer simple, explicit solutions. Do not optimize prematurely.

---

## Rules

- Do not make cosmetic-only changes.
- Do not rename services, containers, networks, volumes, routes, environment
  variables, or APIs without justification.
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions.
- Preserve existing architecture unless structural issues require change.
- Prefer existing patterns over introducing new ones.
- Keep diffs focused and minimal.
- Avoid speculative refactors.

New dependencies must:

- Solve a problem not reasonably handled by existing tooling or dependencies
- Be actively maintained
- Have acceptable security posture
- Be justified in the change summary

---

## Infrastructure Standards

- Write production-ready configurations and code.
- Prefer readability and operational clarity over cleverness.
- Validate all external input and configuration.
- Use explicit configuration instead of hidden defaults.
- Preserve backwards compatibility for persistent storage and public APIs.
- Use healthchecks for long-running services.
- Add comments only when intent is non-obvious.

Errors:

- Errors propagate upward where practical.
- Log failures at application/service boundaries.
- Never swallow errors silently.
- Avoid retry storms or infinite restart loops.

Security:

- Secrets must never be committed.
- Do not hardcode credentials, API keys, or tokens.
- Do not expose internal/admin services publicly unless explicitly required.
- Prefer least-privilege access.
- Avoid disabling security features for convenience.

Networking:

- Public exposure must be intentional.
- Preserve existing ports, routes, middleware, and reverse proxy behavior unless
  changes are required.
- Prefer internal container networking where practical.
- Avoid breaking service discovery or container naming.

Persistence:

- Database migrations must be backwards compatible.
- Never drop volumes, tables, or columns without backup and rollback plans.
- Preserve persistent mount paths and storage layouts.
- SQLite uses WAL mode — do not disable it.
- Backup/restore uses SQLite backup API: `npm run backup:sqlite` / `npm run
  restore:sqlite`

---

## Testing

Before completing any task:

1. Detect project tooling
2. Validate configuration
3. Run linting/type checks where available
4. Run tests where available
5. Verify services start successfully
6. Verify no regressions

All checks must pass before task completion.

Do not ignore failing checks, unhealthy containers, restart loops, or proxy
failures. Never claim something works without verification.

---

## Tooling Detection

Prefer repository-defined scripts and documented workflows over inferred
commands.

Do not invent custom commands. Do not assume frameworks or tooling without
evidence. If tooling is ambiguous, ask before proceeding.

---

## Docker / Containers

Files:

- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml

Commands:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs
```

Rules:

- `docker compose config` must pass before changing compose files.
- Verify containers are healthy before declaring success.
- Check logs when containers fail or restart.
- Preserve the existing container name (`mytube`) and volume (`mytube-data`).
- Watchtower is enabled via label — do not remove
  `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true`.

---

## Node.js / TypeScript

Files:

- `package.json` (root — frontend)
- `server/package.json` (server)

Preferred commands:

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint — max 0 warnings
npm run type-check  # tsc --noEmit
npm run test        # Vitest
npm run build       # tsc -b && vite build
```

Server:

```bash
cd server && npm run dev
```

Rules:

- Prefer scripts defined in `package.json`.
- Do not add dependencies when existing tooling can solve the problem.
- Max warnings set to 0 — lint must be clean.

---

## Reverse Proxy / Ingress

The app serves from port `5173` on the host. If behind a reverse proxy (Caddy,
nginx, Traefik):

- Preserve existing hostnames, routes, and middleware unless required.
- Do not commit TLS certificates or private keys.
- Do not expose admin interfaces publicly.
- The app requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API requests — ensure the
  proxy passes auth headers.

---

## Output Expectations

When making changes:

- Explain what changed
- Explain why
- Identify risks and tradeoffs
- List affected files
- List commands run and results
- Keep explanations concise

---

## Architecture Notes

- **RSS-first design:** All feed data comes from YouTube RSS by default. The
  `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is optional and only used as a capped fallback for channel
  handle resolution.
- **SQLite for state:** Subscriptions, watched state, favorites, queue, feed
  cache, channel refresh state all live in
  `server/data/mytube.sqlite`.
- **No OAuth required.** The app uses RSS feeds and optionally a server-side API
  key for channel resolution.
- **LLM channel discovery (optional):** With `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set, "Discover
  Channels" personalises suggestions via deepseek-v4-flash
  (`server/channel-suggestions.js`); every suggested handle is verified by
  scraping the channel page. Without the key it falls back to related-channel
  search.
- **PWA-capable:** Frontend supports PWA install via `vite-plugin-pwa`.
- **Rate limiting:** Mutating API requests are rate-limited (`30 req / 60s
  window` by default).

## Agent setup and verification

- Use Node 24 (`.node-version`) for frontend, server, and native SQLite dependencies.
- In a new checkout/worktree, run `node scripts/setup.mjs`. It installs both lockfiles and Chromium; `npm run doctor` diagnoses the runtime and optional Docker availability.
- Use `npm run qa` for an authenticated browser against an isolated production build and real API. Use `npm run qa:dev` for HMR. Both allocate ports and create disposable data under ignored `output/qa/`; never point them at production data.
- `npm run test:e2e` owns its build, API, and database. Do not attach the tests to an existing dev server. It checks matching frontend/API build identities before each test.
- Run `npm run check` for lint/types/coverage; `npm run check:full` also runs production browser QA and container smoke when Docker is available. Treat UNAVAILABLE checks as verification gaps, not passes.
- Each QA run prints its URL and artifact directory. Use `server.log`, the HTML report, and retained Playwright traces to investigate failures. Run credentials are in private `run.json`; do not publish the manifest, SQLite database, or browser profile.
- Device-specific playback and installed-PWA behavior still require separate Safari and Home Screen PWA checks on the actual device. A Chromium viewport check is not device evidence.
